# 🧠 CPU (Central Processing Unit)

## Overview
The CPU is the "brain" of the computer, responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations.

## Key Concepts
- **Clock Speed:** Measured in GHz; determines how many cycles per second the CPU can perform.
- **Cores & Threads:** More cores = better multitasking. Threads represent virtual cores.
- **Cache Levels:**
  - L1: Fastest, smallest
  - L2: Medium
  - L3: Largest, shared across cores
- **Architecture:** x86, x64, ARM

## CPU Sockets (Examples)
| Manufacturer | Socket | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Intel | LGA 1700 | 12th–14th gen CPUs |
| AMD | AM4 | Ryzen 1000–5000 |
| AMD | AM5 | Newer Ryzen CPUs |

## Cooling Methods
- Air cooling (heatsinks, fans)
- Liquid cooling (AIO, custom loops)
- Thermal paste application

## Troubleshooting Tips
- Overheating → check thermal paste, airflow, dust
- System won’t POST → reseat CPU, check socket pins
